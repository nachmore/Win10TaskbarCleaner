Remove the Search and Multi-tasking buttons from the Windows 10 Technical Preview

This is a temporary tool for those who don't like the "Search" and "Task View" buttons on the Windows 10 taskbar.

Note: This tool is not written by Microsoft, nor sactioned by Microsoft. I didn't look at the code that powers the taskbar to write this tool (hence the solution is probably a wonky one :) ).

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/nachmore/Win10TaskbarCleaner/issues) if you find any bugs / have requests.
